            <h2>The Legend of Huarong Path</h2>
            <p>Huarong Dao (华容道) is an ancient Chinese sliding block puzzle based on a famous historical event from the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD).</p>
            <p>After Cao Cao's defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, he attempted to escape through the narrow path of Huarong with his remaining forces. The great general Guan Yu, who owed Cao Cao a life debt, encountered him there but ultimately let him go.</p>
            <p>In this puzzle, you must help Cao Cao (the large red block) reach the exit at the bottom. Move the blocks by clicking and dragging them through the narrow path.</p>
